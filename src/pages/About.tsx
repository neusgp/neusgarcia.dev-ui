        Hi, what's up! I'm Neus, a 29 yo girl form Catalonia who's based in
        Germany since 2017. I work as a software developer in a fintech startup.
        Before deciding to get into coding and computers I studied music. I
        actually spent a lot of years studying classical music and practicing
        piano, but now I'm focusing more on programming (which is challenging
        and highly motivating!). I also love to skate and recently I fell in
        love with Roller Derby, a crazy contact sport on quads. I'll tell you
        more about all of this in my posts, you are welcome to read them!
      </p>
